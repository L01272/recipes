    <p>Get ready to turn up the heat with a rich, spicy Japanese curry that’s slow-cooked to perfection over three
        indulgent hours. This dish blends tender meat, hearty vegetables, and a bold blend of spices to create a
        comforting, fiery curry with layers of deep umami flavor. It’s perfect for those who enjoy a meal that simmers
        all afternoon and rewards your patience with every bite.</p>
    <p>Fun fact: although curry is often associated with India, Japanese curry (or kare) was actually introduced to
        Japan by the British in the late 1800s—and today, it’s one of the country's most popular home-cooked dishes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Please gather the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups of Rice (preferably Jasmine or short-grain rice, as they are sticky and absorb the curry well)</li>
        <li>2 medium-sized Potatoes (peeled and cut into bite-sized chunks)</li>
        <li>2 medium-sized Carrots (peeled and sliced into rounds or chunks)</li>
        <li>1-2 medium-sized White Onions (sliced thinly)</li>
        <li>1/2 block of Curry roux</li>
        <li>1 lb of Meat (typically chicken, beef, or pork, cut into bite-sized pieces)</li>
        <li>2-3 cups of Water or Broth (to create the curry base)</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of Soy Sauce (for added depth of flavor)</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of Honey or Apple (to balance the savory with sweetness)</li>
        <li>As much spice as you can handle. (typically this type of curry is pretty mild)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice and cook it according to package instructions. Keep it warm.</li>
        <li>Sauté sliced onions in oil until softened, then add cubed meat, and brown it.</li>
        <li>Add potato chunks and carrot slices, then pour in water or broth and simmer for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in soy sauce, honey (or apple), and curry roux, then let it dissolve and thicken the curry. (for me this goes pretty fast, about 5 minutes)</li>
        <li>Check seasoning, adjust the spice if needed, and serve curry over the rice. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
